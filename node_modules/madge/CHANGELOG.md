## v1.0.0 (Aug 19, 2016)

After 4 years of adding features/fixes it started to be hard to maintain the project and fix some outstanding issues due to how madge was designed to work.

So I decided it was high time for version 1.0 to be released and take the opportunity to do a major rewrite and reduce the size and responsibility of the project and delegate some work to [external libraries](https://github.com/mrjoelkemp/node-dependency-tree). This introduced many breaking changes. Here's the most important ones.

**Added:**

* Automatic module type detection thanks to [precinct](https://github.com/mrjoelkemp/node-precinct)
* Determine image format based on file extension (SVG support)
* Reading [config](README.md#configuration) from `.madgerc` (replaces `--config`)
* Option `--webpack-config` for supporting aliased module paths
* Option `--debug` for turning on debug output

**Changed:**

* Renamed many of the settings in the [config](README.md#configuration)
* Option `--json` should now be used instead of `--output json`
* The generation of the dependency tree is now delegated to the external module [dependency-tree](https://github.com/mrjoelkemp/node-dependency-tree)
* Recurse into child dependencies to get a complete dependency tree of a file
* NPM installed dependencies are now excluded by default
* Node.js core modules are now excluded
* The [API](README.md#api) is now using promises

**Removed:**

* Option `--format` since the format is now detected automatically from the file content
* Option `--optimized` and `--main-require-module` since we no longer support RequireJS builds (r.js)
* Option `--read`
* Option `--find-nested-dependencies`
* Option `--paths`
* Option `--config`
* Option `--output`
* Option `--break-on-error`
* CoffeeScript support
* Event callbacks `onParseFile` and `onAddModule`
* NPM shrinkwrap no longer used
